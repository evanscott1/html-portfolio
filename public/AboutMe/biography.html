  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <h3>
    <p>I have a natural drive to work and be productive with a relentless focus and diligence. I grew up visiting my grandparents’ flower nursey which is where I spent many weekends learning about plants and farmwork. A turning point in my childhood is when an uncle married into the family and moved into my grandparent's house. My uncle Paul brought with him an adventurous spirit from the deserts of Moab, Utah. He also had a love for computers as an avid gamer and ERP systems administrator. Many of my favorite hobbies I learned through Paul: playing board games, mountain biking, video games, Windows PCs, kayaking, etc. As a kid, you don't really have a lot of options to make things happen; you're at the whim of the adults around you. So, I consider Paul a wonderful addition to my childhood and a lifelong friend.</p>
    <p>The second turning point was the summer before my senior year of high school when I got my first smartphone. Apple Podcasts became my new best friend and from there I really discovered what things I wanted to dedicate my life to. I listened to the stories of great entrepreneurs on the show How I Built This by Guy Raz and it sounded like the most entertaining way I could spend my life. I love providing value and starting a business is one of the greatest ways to do that. I also discovered some great mindset focused podcasts that helped me overcome a lot of self-imposed limitations.</p>
    <p>I’ve always struggled to fit in with my peers. I’ve been introverted my entire life and I often focused on things my friends weren’t doing. Even now, I spend my weekends on solo projects. It’s where I do my best work.</p>
    <p>Moving away from home finally gave me the freedom to pursue my dreams. Of course, I still have so many limitations. I recognized quickly that I have lots of energy and focus, but all that being put in the wrong direction was wasted. School has always been a conflict since I’m often required to put energy into things I find frivolous. Despite the limitations and misdirection, I’m doing my best to do what I want. I hope that one day I will have the experience and capabilities to do some truly incredible things.</p>

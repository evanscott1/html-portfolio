  <h1>Chamonix: The Card Game</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <h3>
    <p>I had an idea for a boardgame based off of the ski town in Chamonix, France. I had the chance to visit the town (I didn't go skiing) and it reminded me of the boardgame Carcassone. Carcassone is also based off of a small French town and Chamonix has so many unique features that it seems perfect for a game.</p>
    <p>I'm basing the game mechanics off of the pass-and-play that Sushi Go! has.</p>

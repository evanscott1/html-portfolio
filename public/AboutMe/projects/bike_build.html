      <p>Unfortunately, this morning trip was with a borrowed bike, but I'm hoping to have my own bike for these trips.</p>

    <h2>My neighbor's bike</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>This is where the trouble started. One of the guys that lived below my old apartment was going to toss his bike up on FaceBook marketplace. He asked if I wanted it and I offered him $80 bucks. It came with a flat tire, torn seat, broken helmet, and used up tread. It was a fixer upper for sure</p>

    <h2>New Tires</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>I bought a new tire and some new tubes. Some research online and a call to the bikeshop that sold the bike sent me in the right direction to figure out what bike this is. Of course, all these months later, I don't remember what bike it is. It's some sort of cheap version of the Scott cross country bike.</p>

      <p>I started deconstructing the frame. I want to sand it down and do a custom paint job</p>

    <h2>Bottom Bracket Removal</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>Removing the bottom bracket took some research and tools. I had to figure out the width and number of teeth on the bracket in order to get the right adaptor. The 3/8" breaker bar I had wasn't long enough to give the leverage I needed to loosen the bracket. I bought a 1/2" breaker bar and penetrating oil which, combined with my roommate standing on it, was able to pop the bracket loose.</p>

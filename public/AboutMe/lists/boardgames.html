      <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne"><h2>Carccassone</h2></a>
      <p><h3>Carcassone is one of the earliest strategy games I played as a kid. In 2023, I had the chance to go to the ville of Carcassone in France during a study abroad trip. It was so much fun to visit the city that inspired the game!</h3></p>

      <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor"><h2>Splendor</h2></a>
      <p><h3>Splendor is a classic game in my family that we've been playing for years. It's probably one of the games I'm best at.</h3></p>

      <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor"><h2>Skull</h2></a>
      <p><h3>Skull is a bluffing game like poker and probably one of the games I'm worst at. Just like poker, it requires a lot of patience and waiting for the right moment to move. I love playing this game because it's a chance for me to practice something I'm not very good at.</h3></p>

      <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go"><h2>Sushi Go!</h2></a>
      <p><h3>This is a great game for someone who's never tried sushi before. Every type of sushi scores points in different ways. And they have faces :)</h3></p>

      <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion"><h2>Dominion</h2></a>
      <p><h3>Dominion is a game that Paul recently got, but I first played it when I was 12 years old when a friend introduced it to me. I don't think I fully understood the game or it's strategies when I was younger, but a few play throughs over the holidays and I'm having lots of fun. One unique aspect of this game is that the winning strategy is different every time you play!</h3></p>
